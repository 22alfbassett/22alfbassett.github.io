### More info:
This is just a collection of basic websites that I have created in my free time in between homework and exams. They are mainly for fun and not meant to be taken seriously. Thus, there are probably going to be a lot of bugs. I wanted to upload them so that my friends can try them out. Thank you for trying them and I hope you have fun!
